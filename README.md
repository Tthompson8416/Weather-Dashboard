# Weather-Dashboard

I created a weather dashboard to allow the user to search a specific city to get information on the current and future weather forcast. 
The user enters a city in the search bar and the current weather generates in the main view section.
The city search will also generate a 5 day forcast for weather conditions in that city.
When the user inputs a city, that city is added to the search history. 
Search results in the current conditions section present the user with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index, which is color coded to associate with favorable, moderate, or severe conditions. 
The 5-day forecast displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
When the user clicks on a city in the search history they are presented with current and future conditions for that city.
